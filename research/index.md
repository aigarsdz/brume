	<li> <div> <b>Understanding and Predicting Importance of Abstract Images</b> : Recent work in Computer Vision has explored the importance of objects in an Image. Importance is quantified as the probability of an object in the Image being mentioned in a sentence describing it. This project is an attempt to study and predict importance with semantic features such as gaze, expression and pose, on an abstract scenes dataset.<br/> <a href='https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~s14ece6504/projects/vrama91_importance/index.html'>[Project Page]</a><a href='/docs/abstract_importance.pdf'>[Report]</a>

	<li> <div> <b>Generating Sentences from Abstract Images</b>: Various methods for describing abstract images, both using text corpora associated with images and using only native image content are explored and compared on a metric that measures human agreement. Five methods are compared and evaluated on two metrics and the results discussed.<br/>
