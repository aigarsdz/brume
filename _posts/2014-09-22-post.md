title: Rename project files for Command Line Tools AMT
---

I would often find myself in the situation where I would start woriking on a new interface to launch on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developertools/Amazon-Mechanical-Turk/694">Command Line Tools (CMT)</a>. Its usually cleaner if the names of the question, input and properties, and results files are all as per the name of the new project. Previously, I would manually rename every file. Here is a neat bash script to do this automatically for you.
{% highlight bash %}
for f in old.*
do
       echo "processing old.${f#*.}"
       mv $f new.${f#*.}
done
{% endhighlight %}
Where the files are all originally named with "old".extension and now we wish to rename them with "new".extension.
