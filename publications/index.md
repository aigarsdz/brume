<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<ul>
	<li> <b> Loopy Part Models for Detection and Localization</b> (Internship Project at Ecole Centrale de Paris): A recent inference technique using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) proposed for Medical Image Segmentation by Boussaid et. al was adapted for the Face Detection model of Xu et. al. Results comparable to the state of the art in detection and face landmark localization were achieved. An extension of the ADMM based technique was proposed for detecting multiple faces.</li>
	<li> <div> <b>Understanding and Predicting Importance of Abstract Images</b> : Recent work in Computer Vision has explored the importance of objects in an Image. Importance is quantified as the probability of an object in the Image being mentioned in a sentence describing it. This project is an attempt to study and predict importance with semantic features such as gaze, expression and pose, on an abstract scenes dataset.<br/> <a href='https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~s14ece6504/projects/vrama91_importance/index.html'>[Project Page]</a><a href='/docs/abstract_importance.pdf'>[Report]</a>
	</div>
	<li> <div> <b>Generating Sentences from Abstract Images</b>: Various methods for describing abstract images, both using text corpora associated with images and using only native image content are explored and compared on a metric that measures human agreement. Five methods are compared and evaluated on two metrics and the results discussed.<br/>
		<a href='/docs/generation.pdf'>[Report]</a>
	</li>
	<li> <div> <b>3D reconstruction using Aerial Images</b> (Internship Project at Siemens Research, Bangalore): An SFM pipeline for 3D reconstruction is described that uses several publically available softwares such as Bundlr, PMVS etc.<br/> <a href='/docs/siemens.ppsx'>[Presentation]</a>
	</li>
	<li> <div> <b>Image Stitching and Rectification</b>: This is something I dug up from my undergrad days at IIIT-Hyderabad. The report describes the results from a code that estimated the homography between a pair of images using RANSAC and proceeded to stitch them together. Days when the dataset collection process was just you going out with your camera and snapping a few images ! <br/> <a href='/docs/stitching.pdf'>[Report]</a>
	</li>
	<li> <div> <b>Cansat 2011</b>: CanSat is a NASA sponsored international competition, organized, each year, by American Astronautical Society. The contest allows student teams, from colleges and Universities around the world, to design, build, and fly, according to the criteria spelled out the organizing committee, an aerospace system called CANSAT. Our team from IIIT-Hyderabad won the third place in the 2011 world finals.<br/> <a href='http://web.iiit.ac.in/~ramakrishna.vedantam/Cansat/index.html'>[Press Release]</a>
